# This script is based on the hybrid fan controller script created by @Stux, and posted at:
# https://forums.freenas.org/index.php?threads/script-hybrid-cpu-hd-fan-zone-controller.46159/

# The significant changes from @Stux's script are:
# 1. Replace HD fan control of several discrete duty cycles as a function of hottest HD temperature with a PID controller
#    which controls duty cycle in 1% steps as a function of average HD temperature.  As a protection, if any HD temperature
#    exceeds a specified value, the HD fans are commanded to 100% duty cycle.  This covers cases where one HD may be running 
#    hot, even if the average HD temperature is acceptable, or the PID loop control has gone awry.
# 2. Add optional setting to command CPU fans to 100% duty cycle if needed to assist with HD cooling, to cover scenarios 
#    where the CPU fan zone also controls chassis exit fans.
# 3. Add optional log of HD fan temperatures, PID loop values and commanded fan duty cycles.  The log may optionally contain
#    a record of each HD temperature, or only the coolest and warmest HD temperatures.
# 4. Added ability to specify the number of warmest disks to use when calculating the average temperature.
# 5. Added ability to put certain configuration values in a configuration file that is checked each time around the control loop.

# This script is designed to control both the CPU and HD fans in a Supermicro X10 based system according to both
# the CPU and HD temperatures in order to minimize noise while providing sufficient cooling to deal with scrubs
# and CPU torture tests. It may work in X9 based systems, but this has not been tested.  It has been found to work on at least
# the X11SSM-F.

# It relies on the motherboard having two fan zones, FAN1..FAN4 and FANA..FANC.

# To use this correctly, you should connect all your PWM HD fans, by splitters if necessary to the FANA..FANC headers, or to
# the numbered FAN1..FAN4 headers.   The CPU, case and exhaust fans should then be connected to the other headers.  This script 
# will then control the HD fans in response to the HD temp, and the other fans in response to CPU temperature. When CPU 
# temperature is high the HD fans will be used to provide additional cooling, if you specify cpu/hd shared cooling.

# If the fans should be high, and they are stuck low, or vice-versa, the BMC will be rebooted, thus it is critical to set the
# cpu/hd_max_fan_speed variables correctly.

# NOTE: It is highly likely the "get_hd_temp" function will not work as-is with your HDs. Until a better solution is provided
# you will need to modify this function to properly acquire the temperature. Setting debug=2 will help.

# Tested with a SuperMicro X10SRH-cF, Xeon E5-1650v4, Noctua 120, 90 and 80mm fans in a Norco RPC-4224 4U chassis, with 16 x 4 TB WD Red drives.

# The IPMI fan lower and upper fan speed thresholds must be adjusted to be compatible with the fans used.  Do not rely 
# completely on manufacturer specs to determine the slowest and fastest possible fan speeds, as some fans have been found
# to run at speeds that differ somewhat from the official specs.  See: 
# https://forums.freenas.org/index.php?resources/how-to-change-ipmi-sensor-thresholds-using-ipmitool.35/

# The following ipmitool commands can be run when connected to the FreeNAS server via ssh.  They are useful to set a desired fan duty cycle before
# checking the fan speeds.

# Set duty cycle in Zone 0 to 100%: ipmitool raw 0x30 0x70 0x66 0x01 0x00 100  
# Set duty cycle in Zone 0 to  50%: ipmitool raw 0x30 0x70 0x66 0x01 0x00 50
# Set duty cycle in Zone 0 to  20%: ipmitool raw 0x30 0x70 0x66 0x01 0x00 20

# Set duty cycle in Zone 1 to 100%: ipmitool raw 0x30 0x70 0x66 0x01 0x01 100
# Set duty cycle in Zone 1 to  50%: ipmitool raw 0x30 0x70 0x66 0x01 0x01 50
# Set duty cycle in Zone 1 to  20%: ipmitool raw 0x30 0x70 0x66 0x01 0x01 20

# Check duty cycle in Zone 0:                   ipmitool raw 0x30 0x70 0x66 0x00 0x00
# result is hex, with 64 being 100% duty cycle.  32 is 50% duty cycle.  14 is 20% duty cycle.

#  Check duty cycle in Zone 1:                  ipmitool raw 0x30 0x70 0x66 0x00 0x01
# result is hex, with 64 being 100% duty cycle.  32 is 50% duty cycle.  14 is 20% duty cycle.

# Check fan speeds using: ipmitool sdr

# Number of warmest disks to average
# Originally, the script would calculate an average temperature for all disks, and vary fan speed as required to achieve the target 
# temperature.  Later, the option was added to have the script only worry about the warmest X disks, and use the average of those
# disks as the target.  This better accomadated the common situation where there are several disks that run several degrees warmer
# than the others, and it is desired to keep those warm disks from exceeding a specified temperature.

# If desired, certain settings may be defined in a configuration file that can be changed on the fly, while the script is running.
# The script will check the latest modification time of the config file each time it determines the new fan duty cycle, and reload
# the configuration data if it has changed.  This is useful when testing the script, as the PID control gains, average disk target
# temperature and number of warmest disk temperatures to average

# VERSION HISTORY
#####################
# 2016-09-19 Initial Version
# 2016-09-19 Added cpu_hd_override_temp, to prevent HD fans cycling when CPU fans are sufficient for cooling CPU
# 2016-09-26 hd_list is now refreshed before checking HD temps so that we start/stop monitoring devices that
#            have been hot inserted/removed.
#            "Drives are warm, going to 75%" log message was missing an unless clause causing it to print
#            every time
# 2016-10-07 Replaced get_cpu_temp() function with get_cpu_temp_sysctl() which queries the kernel, instead of
#            IPMI. This is faster, more accurate and more compatible, hopefully allowing this to work on X9
#            systems. The original function is still present and is now called get_cpu_temp_ipmi(). 
#            Because this is a much faster method of reading the temps,  and because its actually the max core 
#            temp, I found that the previous cpu_hd_override_temp of 60 was too sensitive and caused the override 
#            too often. I've bumped it up to 62, which on my system seems good. This means that if a core gets to 
#            62C the HD fans will kick in, and this will generally bring temps back down to around 60C... depending 
#            on the actual load. Your results will vary, and for best results you should tune controller with 
#            mprime testing at various thread levels. Updated the cpu threasholds to 35/45/55 because of the improved
#            responsiveness of the get_cpu_temp function
#
# The following changes are by Kevin Horton
# 2017-01-14 Reworked get_hd_list() to exclude SSDs
#            Added function to calculate maximum and average HD temperatures.
#            Replaced original HD fan control scheme with a PID controller, controlling the average HD temp..
#            Added safety override if any HD reaches a specified max temperature.  If so, the PID loop is overridden, 
#            and HD fans are set to 100%
#            Retain float value of fan duty cycle between loop cycles, so that small duty cycle corrections 
#            accumulate and eventually push the duty cycle to the next integer value.
# 2017-01-18 Added log file
# 2017-01-21 Refactored code to bump up CPU fan to help cool HD.  Drop the variabe CPU duty cycle, and just set to High,
#            Added log file option without temps for every HD.
# 2017-01-29 Add header to log file every X hours
#
# 2018-08-24 v1.0 Version optimized for 1500 rpm Noctua NF-F12 fans
# 
# 2018-08-25 Revised gains and thresholds for 3000 rpm Noctua NF-F12 iPPC fans
#            Added 10s pause before checking fan speed, to allow time for fans to respond to latest gain change
#
# 2018-09-17 Revised HD temp average to only look at warmest X disks.
#
# 2018-09-27 Use config file to determine number of warmest disks to average, PID gains and target average temperature.
#            The config file may be revised while the script is running, and the updated values will be read into the script 
#            each time around the control loop.
#
# 2020-01-01 Merged options for selectable number of disks to average and certain settings in config file to 
#            Master branch
#
# TO DO
#           Do not change fan speed due to calculated Tave changes when switching config scripts

## CONFIGURATION
################

##CONFIG FILE
## Read following config file at start and every X minutes to determine number of warmest disks to average,
## target average temperature and PID gains.  If file is not available, or corrupt, use defaults specified
## in this script.
$config_file = '/root/nas_fan_control/PID_fan_control_config.ini';

##DEFAULT VALUES
## Use the values declared below if the config file is not present
$stop_default = "full";      # Default state to fans
$hd_ave_target = 38;         # PID control loop will target this average temperature for the warmest N disks
$Kp = 16/3;                  # PID control loop proportional gain
$Ki = 0;                     # PID control loop integral gain
$Kd = 24;                    # PID control loop derivative gain
$hd_num_peak = 2;            # Number of warmest HDs to use when calculating average temp
$hd_fan_duty_start     = 60; # HD fan duty cycle when script starts

## DEBUG LEVEL
## 0 means no debugging. 1,2,3,4 provide more verbosity
## You should run this script in at least level 1 to verify its working correctly on your system
$debug = 0;
$debug_log = '/root/Debug_PID_fan_control.log';

## LOG
$log = '/root/PID_fan_control.log';
$log_temp_summary_only      = 0; # 1 if not logging individual HD temperatures.  0 if logging temp of each HD
$log_header_hourly_interval = 2; # number of hours between log headers.  Valid options are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 & 12.
                                 # log headers will always appear at the start of a log, at midnight and any 
                                 # time the list of HDs changes (if individual HD temperatures are logged)

## CPU THRESHOLD TEMPS
## A modern CPU can heat up from 35C to 60C in a second or two. The fan duty cycle is set based on this
$high_cpu_temp = 55;       # will go HIGH when we hit
$med_cpu_temp  = 45;       # will go MEDIUM when we hit, or drop below again
$low_cpu_temp  = 35;       # will go LOW when we fall below 35 again

## HD THRESHOLD TEMPS
## HD change temperature slowly. 
## This is the temperature that we regard as being uncomfortable. The higher this is the
## more silent your system.
## Note, it is possible for your HDs to go above this... but if your cooling is good, they shouldn't.
# $hd_ave_target = 38.0;   # define this value in the DEFAULT VALUES block at top of script
$hd_max_allowed_temp = 40; # celsius. PID control aborts and fans set to 100% duty cycle when a HD hits this temp.
                           # This ensures that no matter how poorly chosen the PID gains are, or how much of a spread
                           # there is between the average HD temperature and the maximum HD temperature, the HD fans 
                           # will be set to 100% if any drive reaches this temperature.

## NUMBER OF WARMEST HD TO AVERAGE                           
# $hd_num_peak = 4;        # average the temperatures of this many warmest hard drives when calculating the average disk temperature

## CPU TEMP TO OVERRIDE HD FANS
## when the CPU climbs above this temperature, the HD fans will be overridden
## this prevents the HD fans from spinning up when the CPU fans are capable of providing 
## sufficient cooling.
$cpu_hd_override_temp = 65;

## CPU/HD SHARED COOLING
## If your HD fans contribute to the cooling of your CPU you should set this value.
## It will mean when you CPU heats up your HD fans will be turned up to help cool the
## case/cpu. This would only not apply if your HDs and fans are in a separate thermal compartment.
$hd_fans_cool_cpu = 1;      # 1 if the hd fans should spin up to cool the cpu, 0 otherwise

## HD FAN DUTY CYCLE TO OVERRIDE CPU FANS
$cpu_fans_cool_hd            = 1;  # 1 if the CPU fans should spin up to cool the HDs, when needed.  0 otherwise.  This may be 
                                   #   useful if the CPU fan zone also contains chassis exit fans, as an increase in chassis exit 
                                   #   fan speed may increase the HD cooling air flow.
$hd_cpu_override_duty_cycle = 95;  # when the HD duty cycle equals or exceeds this value, the CPU fans may be overridden to help cool HDs

## CPU TEMP CONTROL
$cpu_temp_control = 1;  # 1 if the script will control a CPU fan to control CPU temperatures.  0 if the script only controls HD fans.

## PID CONTROL GAINS
## If you were using the spinpid.sh PID control script published by @Glorious1 at the link below, you will need to adjust the value of $Kp
## that you were using, as that script defined Kp in terms of the gain per one cycle around the loop, but this script defines it in terms
## of the gain per minute.  Divide the Kp value from the spinpid.sh script by the time in minutes for checking hard drive temperatures. 
## For example, if you used a gain of Kp = 8, and a T = 3 (3 minute interval), the new value is $Kp = 8/3.
## Kd values from the spinpid.sh script can be used directly here.
